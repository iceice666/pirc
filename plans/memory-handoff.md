# Memory redesign: one handoff, independent long-term memory, original sources

This is the Rust continuation of the approved A–D plan. Upstream `main` replaced the TypeScript runtime before integration; the maintainer explicitly chose to port the redesign to Rust. The old runtime is not restored. This document describes the resulting contracts, dependencies and acceptance criteria. Deployment and activation of existing ledgers remain separate operations; neither is authorized by this document.

## Data flow and ownership

```text
Original append-only session JSONL
  ├─ bounded complete prefix → structured handoff → recent raw tail → main request
  ├─ complete original interaction → independent extractor → repository journal
  └─ public source projection → history_search / history_read

Gateway USER / personal MEMORY → fresh Chat-owned block
Authorized repository journal → fresh Work-owned block
Repository journal → atomic mirror frame + integrity checkpoint → gateway search
```

A handoff is session-local continuation state. Work knowledge crosses authorized main sessions and worktrees of the same repository. Starting another session does not import the previous session's unfinished task, entire handoff, tool state or approvals. Processing another registered source does not require reopening its agent. Complete interactions can be processed independently; a receipt for a later interaction never claims an unfinished earlier interaction was processed.

Chat retains the gateway's per-user personal MEMORY, approved USER entries, capability policy and dedicated cross-session search/recall. Work retains the newer upstream mode behavior that can expose approved USER preferences; it does not receive Chat's personal MEMORY. Work extraction treats injected preferences and replayed history as derived evidence. Current-session history tools cannot accept an owner, workspace, session directory or arbitrary source path. Cross-session evidence goes through the dedicated Work or gateway resolver, with ownership and mode checks.

Mode definitions, tool allowlists, delegation rules and the existing sandbox remain authoritative. Model summaries and legacy OM labels cannot grant permission. The automatic action classifier follows snapshot references back to original human messages rather than accepting generated observation text as approval. Partial originals are explicitly labeled and cannot establish authorization.

## Four phases and dependencies

| Phase | Depends on                                         | Responsibility                                                                                 |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A     | Existing Rust store, private persistence and modes | Strict source reading, synchronized recovery, provenance and compatible settings               |
| B     | A                                                  | Independent Work extraction, atomic journal mutations, repository cutover and mirror integrity |
| C     | A                                                  | One structured handoff engine for manual, threshold and overflow compaction                    |
| D     | B and C                                            | Fresh owned prompt blocks, archive-only legacy readers and retirement of the OM pipeline       |

B and C share contracts but neither uses the other's coverage. The implementation order remains A → B → C → D. Fixture tests do not establish full process integration; validation must identify the level actually exercised.

### A — Source and recovery foundation

Files:

- `crates/pirc-agent/src/journal.rs`: descriptor-based OS mutex, pinned mutex/fence identities, bounded strict JSONL parsing and writer-open recovery.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/session_store.rs`: parent/header validation, compare-and-append, atomic compaction records, recovery/read-back and atomic branch edits.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/state_io.rs`, `crates/pirc-node/src/persistence.rs`, `crates/pirc-node/src/inference.rs`: node-mediated writes into the agent's read-only private state. Revoke and drain the existing persistence lease before replacing its runner.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/history.rs`, `crates/pirc-node/src/workspace_memory.rs`, `crates/pirc-node/src/runner/side.rs`: bounded source projections, identity binding and return-time revalidation.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/features/memory/config.rs`, `crates/pirc-agent/src/config/memory.rs`: fieldwise settings compatibility. An invalid tuning field must not re-enable a valid explicit disable flag.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/ptc/mod.rs`, `ptc/registry.rs`, `features/memory/serialize.rs`: replay provenance through operations and stores, including restarts; secret redaction, forged-header defenses and omission of private thinking.

Readers do not repair session logs. Writer opening may preserve an interrupted final fragment as evidence, synchronize the evidence, repair the tail and synchronize the file and parent directory. Mid-file corruption, invalid complete records and broken parent chains fail visibly. A valid final record missing its delimiter is finished under writer authority. No append may continue after an unknown persistence result until reopen/reconciliation.

The OS mutex and empty `.writer-lock` directory are different: the mutex is actual mutual exclusion; the directory is a compatibility fence. Never delete or steal an old PID lock because its age looks stale. Busy, interrupted, unsupported and unavailable locking failures have distinct outcomes. macOS and Linux use the same contract. Branch mutation holds the original journal transaction while publishing the replacement; failed temporary branch entries are discarded from memory too.

### B — Independent Work memory

Files:

- `crates/pirc-agent/src/workspace_journal.rs`: v2 control, immutable jobs, epoch/generation/revision, additions, retirements, source tombstones, cutover/clear boundaries and successful extraction receipts.
- `crates/pirc-node/src/workspace_memory.rs`: registry-bound source selection and shared request-local source snapshots. No model-supplied path or ownership claims are trusted.
- `crates/pirc-node/src/runner/side.rs`: bind original caller, runner epoch, mode, owner and repository; serialize the synchronous commit with the existing runner lifecycle mutex; revalidate before delivery.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/features/workspace_memory.rs`: bounded single-call extraction, legacy model/fallback/cooldown settings, source citation validation, refresh and explicit commands.
- `crates/pirc-node/src/memory_mirror.rs`, `crates/pirc-gateway/src/memory_records.rs`, `agent_ops.rs`, `db.rs`, `schema.sql`: atomic projection plus content checkpoints, gateway readiness and authorized checkpoint lookup. Schema 1006 adds the nullable mirror digest without rewriting legacy records.

Normal work consumes complete original interactions independently of OM and compaction. At most three jobs are processed per sync; a job uses one model call. Oversized interactions stop with a visible budget error and no receipt. The raw evidence bound is 128 KiB per job and the shared source-scan bound is 64 MiB per request. No source is silently truncated to create coverage. Retiring a contradicted note and adding its replacement share one transaction with the receipt. A validated successful empty result is distinct from failure. Duplicate content need not create another note.

Generation/revision and source authority are rechecked inside the journal transaction, immediately before writing. Model work never holds that lock. A changed owner, mode, registry path, source identity or generation prevents the candidate from committing. Source fingerprints and one parsed snapshot are reused for return-time checks. The existing runner mutex prevents a stopped/replaced runner from making a delayed commit.

`clear` records the original captured boundaries and changes generation. The host validates the complete captured source set, unique session identities and original entry cutoffs; an incomplete or changed capture is refused before writing. Continuing an unfinished pre-clear turn cannot relearn its orphan continuation. `forget` preserves source suppression through clear and explicit catchup, including legacy observation/reflection provenance. Suppression follows the original human interaction start even if a later assistant continuation extends its end. Raw session history is retained; forgetting a note is not a promise to erase already delivered text or every semantic paraphrase.

A lost ACK is an unknown outcome. Keep a bounded, ephemeral map of original immutable jobs (maximum 64), withhold the Work prompt block and inspect receipts through the same authority and mirror gate. An absent receipt with unchanged CAS is still pending. A durable matching job proves success; a changed CAS can prove an uncommitted job can no longer succeed. `forbidden` and `not_found` may be return-time errors after commit and are not prewrite proof. Explicit retries reuse original inputs and clear cutoffs; there is no automatic destructive replay loop. In-flight mutations continue to withhold old notes until settled. Return-time source and ownership checks apply to mutation acknowledgements as well as reads, because control metadata also contains source identities.

Repository activation is explicit: stop all older node, standalone and child writers, including other worktrees, then use `/om:workspace cold --writers-stopped`. The permanent empty `<key>.lock` directory preserves the TypeScript cutover marker. A versioned ledger restored to legacy content must not fall through into legacy injection, even before the gateway has acknowledged its new tail. Opening an already-versioned writer handles recovery; it does not activate a legacy ledger. Old PID lock files require operator handling and are never automatically removed.

The mirror carries a complete validated projection and an integrity checkpoint in one gateway transaction. Invalid additions cannot leave a valid retirement applied. Capacity rejection also rolls back the whole versioned frame. Acknowledged prefix hashes fence shrink and equal-length replacement. Legacy checkpoints use an exact projection proof before acquiring a digest. Stale/non-advancing ACKs cannot trigger unbounded immediate retransmission or regress a checkpoint. Incompatible or unavailable authority withholds notes; it never authorizes an unsafe local fallback.

### C — One handoff compactor

Files:

- `crates/pirc-agent/src/handoff.rs`: structured state, deterministic rendering, lineage, source references, human constraint changes and tool group boundaries.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/handoff_compactor.rs`: fixed ranges, complete source pages, proof validation, bounded attempts and one commit.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/compaction.rs`, `agent.rs`, `features/compact.rs`: shared effective budgets and a single entry point for manual, threshold and overflow requests.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/auto_mode/classifier.rs`: original human evidence lookup.
- `crates/pirc-providers/src/models_file.rs`: opaque, secret-free routing fingerprints for the public catalog.

Only a valid snapshot can advance the compaction boundary. A new snapshot extends the previous valid one over one contiguous original range; source/state/summary/boundary/job identity are published in one entry. Invalid latest snapshots fall back to the last valid snapshot and its raw tail. Legacy summaries are inherited and explicitly unverified; the new increment must still be present and validated.

Whole source text is paginated; later pages cannot revoke established constraints before the full later original human message is available. A constraint removal requires the exact later human quote retained in decisions with the same source. Assistant/tool assertions cannot remove a human constraint. Reaffirming a constraint advances its evidence position. Only `stopReason=toolUse` issues calls. Duplicate/open/orphan groups and PTC parentage are checked consistently when compacting and reopening. Private entries are not coverage evidence.

Effective model window, output reserve, prompt/tools and provider projection govern both preflight and the final request. Only the implicit reserve scales down; explicit policy remains explicit. Secret-free route identity includes public opaque routing fingerprints. Compare it before every handoff call, after every await (including failed/invalid/timeout replies) and immediately before commit. Changed routing supersedes old output/errors; cancellation wins. A timeout cancels its child request.

Automatic attempts remain limited to two per unchanged identity with a 60-second cooldown across restart. Manual retry remains available. A job has a 60-second timeout and at most 16 chunks by default. Failure, abort, invalid references, source changes, exhausted chunks or an oversized/non-reducing result leave the boundary unchanged. Live usage calibration binds the observed message, route and prompt basis; a changed prefix can reuse the observed scale, while known model mismatches and newer compaction invalidate stale reported totals after restart.

### D — Refresh and retirement

Files:

- `crates/pirc-agent/src/feature.rs`, `agent.rs`: stable-order replacement of feature-owned prompt sections, dirty invalidation, cancellable refresh and shared preflight admission.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/features/assistant/mod.rs`, `features/workspace_memory.rs`: fresh Chat/Work blocks at model-turn boundaries; failed, denied, cancelled or superseded replies cannot restore a previous block or relax policy.
- `crates/pirc-agent/src/features/memory/mod.rs`, `ledger.rs`, `workspace.rs`: small legacy readers and ID recall.
- `crates/pirc-node/src/panels/mod.rs`, `apps/web/src/lib/panel-api.ts`, `components/panel/MemoryTab.svelte`: handoff/legacy ancestry and separate refresh/extraction/pending status.
- `nix/package.nix`: installed CLI session creation/reopen smoke checks, isolated from user state.

Remove the active Observer, Reflector, Dropper and promoter modules. Keep old observations, reflections, folded details, IDs and sources readable; do not rewrite everything into a new summary. Frozen prompt entries and `context.json` are diagnostic/archive data, not fresh memory authorities. Missing policy fields or an offline gateway do not relax existing restrictions. Idle extraction remains bound to the run's cancellation signal.

## Compatibility and operation

| Existing data/settings                                  | Result                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Valid session JSONL / unknown entry types               | Preserve identity, ancestry and uninterpreted fields                                                   |
| Legacy OM observation/reflection IDs and folded details | Archive/recall retained; no new OM jobs                                                                |
| Legacy compaction with missing earlier ancestry         | Inherit the summary as unverified; validate the new tail independently                                 |
| Legacy repository notes                                 | Retain IDs, content and provenance; read-only until explicit repository cutover                        |
| Pre-cutover raw backlog                                 | Explicit `catchup`; never claim the cutover boundary was model-processed                               |
| `features.observationalMemory.workspace`                | Legacy fieldwise alias; explicit `workspaceMemory` fields take precedence                              |
| Legacy disable/passive/model/fallback choices           | Preserve their meaning; explicit canonical enable may opt Work back in; forced passive stays effective |
| Positive old Work budgets above 32000                   | Accept configuration; cap the effective transport block at 32000                                       |
| Already accepted mutation with lost response            | Confirm or explicitly retry the same job; never infer failure from timeout alone                       |

The Rust mainline's database transition from TypeScript is a separate upstream migration constraint. This memory port preserves memory files/settings; it does not claim to make the upstream Rust services accept every old TypeScript SQLite database. Never downgrade a binary into an already-activated v2 ledger. Back up and restore the journal and its authoritative mirror checkpoints together. A missing source, damaged middle record or divergent checkpoint requires repair rather than silent coverage advancement.

## Acceptance gates

| Gate | Required evidence                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A1   | Reader never edits; interrupted tail recovery preserves evidence and survives reopen                                                             |
| A2   | Old PID locks are not stolen; replaced mutex/fence identities, sync failures, unsupported locks and hardlinks fail safely                        |
| A3   | Current-session history has complete bounded pages; private thinking/state are absent; foreign paths/owners are rejected                         |
| A4   | Replay provenance survives PTC operations, stores and restart; invalid config fields cannot re-enable disabled memory                            |
| B1   | Work B can process A's authorized raw interaction without starting A; Chat and foreign/deleted sources are denied                                |
| B2   | Empty results, additions, replacements and their receipts are atomic; failures never manufacture success receipts                                |
| B3   | Concurrent generation/authority changes reject commit; runner replacement fences delayed writes                                                  |
| B4   | Clear/forget survive unknown ACKs, explicit retries, restart, catchup and legacy sources without resurrecting revoked notes                      |
| B5   | Cold cutover preserves legacy data and markers; stale/rollback mirrors and malformed/quota-rejected frames cannot revoke only half a replacement |
| B6   | View cursors bind ordered rendered inventory and authority; empty receipts alone do not invalidate a page                                        |
| C1   | Manual/threshold/overflow share one writer; raw sources survive successful compaction and process restart                                        |
| C2   | Multi-page ranges and tool groups have no silent gaps or truncation; future/foreign/private references are rejected                              |
| C3   | Human constraints require complete later original evidence; reaffirmation and quote retention survive page boundaries                            |
| C4   | Invalid output, abort, timeout, source change, no reduction or chunk/budget exhaustion leave coverage unchanged                                  |
| C5   | Route changes win over stale errors/JSON/timeouts; automatic restart cannot reset retry limits; final main request is budget checked             |
| D1   | Fresh owned blocks preserve feature order; revoked/failed/late replies cannot restore stale memory or policy                                     |
| D2   | Chat personal memory and Work repository knowledge remain separate; Work crosses authorized sessions, handoffs do not                            |
| D3   | macOS/Linux unit and real-process tests, front-end checks/build and installed-package session checks identify their actual scope                 |

Model-generated summaries and extraction still require separate quality evaluation. Structural validation proves provenance, boundaries and bounded execution; it cannot prove that a model preserved every important meaning. Oversized Work interactions and unavailable/changed sources remain visible operational limits, never silently counted as processed.

## Validation record

Validated on 2026-10-22 against Rust mainline `59ba8f36e4e5c437686373c52b4aa6bbe9d84da1`:

- macOS workspace tests excluding conformance: 1,109 passed, 3 explicitly ignored. The last Work and journal changes additionally passed 7 and 9 focused regression tests. Real macOS sandbox, persistence and browser integration tests passed.
- Linux workspace tests excluding conformance passed (1,148 tests, 6 explicitly ignored). Final Linux library/binary validation passed 1,018 tests, with 2 explicitly ignored; this includes the final continuation/forget, descriptor exclusion and source-boundary regressions.
- Linux real-process conformance ran against freshly built node/gateway executables with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`; every scenario passed. Structured handoff, Work extraction and PTC history replay tests assert boundaries and permissions directly. Encoded source IDs/timestamps are normalized structurally; timer-based PTC progress is excluded only from two feature authority transcripts, with all operation events/final results retained and dedicated PTC coverage unchanged.
- `cargo fmt --all --check` and workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings` passed. Front-end typecheck reported zero errors/warnings; all 372 web tests and 18 script tests passed; the production web build passed. Prettier, version, catalog and browser asset checks passed.
- Nix 2.35.3 built the Linux node package and passed the installed wrapper's offline session create/reopen checks, stable header and compatibility-fence checks. The pinned Nix formatter was applied. Linux host tests requiring unavailable bubblewrap/Chromium or an unprivileged host report their scope separately; a container run is not evidence for those host sandbox cases.

Initial disk-full failures were rerun after clearing task-owned build caches. A wall-clock glob performance test was rerun successfully without competing release compilation; no production glob behavior or timing threshold was changed. Final validation results above come from the Rust port, not the historical TypeScript run. Test-only fixtures use isolated temporary state. No existing user ledger has been activated and no deployment has been performed.

## Rust review corrections

The post-port review adds regression gates without activating any existing ledger:

- Integrity mirror frames validate quota against their final transactional projection. A later clear/forget can coalesce the validated unacknowledged tail through the latest revocation whose public projection fits the existing node-frame limit, including across the normal chunk boundary, while preserving tombstones, superseded records, the original byte digest and the previous checkpoint. Request-local incremental byte accounting selects that checkpoint in one scan; an oversized later replacement cannot hide an earlier bounded clear/forget. Ordinary bounded chunks remain the fallback when no revocation fits. Quota is never increased and rejected frames remain atomic.
- Known immutable mutation rejections share one classification. Invalid retirement IDs are checked against the supplied active notes before RPC; host rejections do not become permanent unknown jobs. Permission, transport, lock-contention and synchronization failures remain conservative unknown outcomes, including explicit retries.
- Source admission and final revalidation share ownership and session-deletion eligibility in the existing database snapshot. A deletion fence excludes the source before physical cleanup finishes.
- Legacy global passive remains effective unless canonical Work passive explicitly overrides it; forced passive still wins. Malformed control flags use safe fieldwise defaults. Legacy and canonical workspace diagnostics share field/model definitions.
- One task/tool classifier serves provider projection, safe cut selection and handoff validation. Scheduled/delegated admissions are task boundaries, never fresh human authorization. A subsequent task admission can close an interrupted attempt as unknown; a still-open tool group with no subsequent admission remains ineligible. Original session files gain no fabricated results or recovery flags.
- Partial capability refreshes update explicit booleans only; omitted or malformed fields retain current policy. Initial legacy decoding remains compatible.

Required regression sequences include quota rejection followed by clear/forget and reconnect, a deleting foreign source with its files still present, deterministic prewrite rejection versus ambiguous postcommit failure, scheduled-only compaction, crash/reopen with an unanswered tool call, passive precedence and partial policy refreshes. Test ledgers are isolated temporary fixtures, never user ledgers.

Post-review validation on macOS (2026-10-22): 1,128 unique Rust workspace tests passed, with 3 existing ignored cases. The final workspace run was completed in segments: one browser first-screencast test initially reported `no frame`; all 19 browser-engine tests then passed in an isolated serial retry, and the remaining workspace targets passed separately. Browser assertions and timeouts were unchanged. All 34 real-process tests across memory, compaction, assistant, memory replay, assistant PTC and original-human authorization passed against the final rebuilt binaries with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting and the plan's Markdown formatting passed. This correction run was on macOS; the earlier Linux/Nix evidence above describes the original port. No deployment or activation of existing ledgers was performed.

## Recovery and interleaving follow-up

- Canonical Work fields override legacy aliases individually, including malformed legacy workspace values; only explicit forced passive overrides canonical `passive: false`. Invalid canonical control flags still fail closed.
- Recorded tool results are matched by issued call ID and tool name. Provider-only projection puts each real result with its original call group before continuing with interleaved tasks or assistant messages; missing attempts get error results only in the projection. Durable session entries are unchanged.
- Raw PTC operation lookahead keeps an interrupted outer call open across an earlier task admission until its recorded nested operations have been consumed. A subsequent admission can then close the missing outer result as unknown. Orphaned, duplicate and non-PTC-parent operations remain invalid. Compaction chooses candidates using these same raw boundaries, including when the recent-context budget would otherwise prefer an unsafe cut; restart retains the same validated coverage.
- The node's test-only conformance dependency drives an actual agent process against an isolated real host journal. For both clear and forget, the host commits durably, the first ACK is completely withheld until the production timeout, the original immutable request is resent without changing journal bytes/revision/cutoffs, and a further lost delivery is resolved through a real committed-job proof. Authority loss while the result is unknown does not reveal notes or clear the pending identity. No production transport fault flags, locks or durable recovery state are added.

Follow-up validation on macOS (2026-10-22): 1,040 distinct library/binary tests passed, with 2 existing ignored cases, assembled from workspace library/binary runs and focused final reruns. All 60 real-process scenarios across 12 conformance targets passed with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`, including memory, compaction commands, original-human authorization, core ordering and PTC. The actual-agent/host clear/forget ACK-loss integration uses the production timeout and confirms immutable replay, committed proofs and denial during authority loss. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting, Markdown formatting and diff whitespace checks passed. Empty-session compaction retains its existing public error. Test normalization removes only redundant canonical-path annotations caused by macOS aliases; distinct symlink targets and write denials remain asserted, and no golden snapshots were updated. This follow-up was validated on macOS; the earlier Linux/Nix evidence remains scoped to the original port. No existing user ledger was activated and no deployment was performed.

## Quota fallback, call occurrences and unknown retries

- A quota rejection carries an optional `rejectedEnd` in the existing mirror ACK. The node accepts the hint only for the exact in-flight endpoint at the unchanged acknowledged watermark. On the existing retry timer, it selects a strictly earlier, frame-bounded clear/forget projection. If none remains, it cycles back to the latest candidate so released capacity can restore progress. Successful advancement discards the transient hint. Reconnect at the same acknowledged base retains its deadline and retreat, after validating the original bytes; a changed base discards it. Older ACKs remain valid; older peers simply lack this recovery hint. Ledger bytes, digests, atomic quota checks and persistent checkpoint formats are unchanged.
- The shared tool classifier identifies each issued call by its entry position and call index. A matching recorded result releases the external tool ID for another round; unresolved or interrupted IDs remain reserved. PTC operation IDs are unique within their parent occurrence. Raw-entry lookahead, interruption annotations and provider result ordering all use that occurrence, including private metadata and interleaved task admissions. Recovery adds no fabricated durable entries and never treats a synthetic error as evidence that an action completed.
- The existing in-flight mutation counter becomes a single transient RPC gate, released even if the future is dropped. Parallel retries cannot overwrite or remove a pending identity. Retried operations must retain their original arguments. A known prewrite rejection clears a fresh attempt only; rejecting a retry cannot prove that its earlier timed-out request will never commit. Until success or an authoritative committed/failed proof, notes remain unavailable. Same-CAS absence remains pending. No lock, persistent recovery record, retry-limit increase or permission expansion is introduced.
- Regression gates include a small frame whose final projection still exceeds gateway quota, fallback to an earlier clear, stale rejection hints, reconnect and capacity restoration; completed rounds reusing tool and nested-operation IDs, late PTC evidence and unresolved duplicate rejection; and real agent/host overlapping resends, reversible retry rejection, a genuinely delayed original commit, ignored expired ACKs and authoritative confirmation. Legacy settings, read-only cold cutover and Chat/Work authority gates remain in force.

Validation on macOS (2026-10-22): the final rebuilt binaries passed the complete workspace library and binary runs (1,047 tests passed, 2 existing ignored), including both real-agent/host ACK-loss integration scenarios for clear and forget. All 60 scenarios across the same 12 real-process conformance targets passed with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting, Markdown formatting and diff whitespace checks passed. The first quota-fallback fixture exceeded the per-note size limit; it was corrected to valid multiple notes above the chunk boundary, and the full final suite passed. No golden snapshots were updated. This correction run was on macOS; earlier Linux/Nix evidence remains scoped to the original port. No existing user ledger was activated and no deployment was performed. Task-owned build artifacts and temporary scripts/logs were removed after validation.

## Reconnect and late-delivery corrections

- Quota retreat remains in the existing in-flight mirror state across disconnects and refused local sends. Reconnect preserves only quota recovery at the same gateway watermark, and a validated byte-prefix check prevents reusing a hint for replaced data. A bounded resend keeps its rejection bound until acknowledgement advances. Retry deadlines and the existing retry interval remain unchanged; restart still reconstructs from the durable gateway checkpoint without a new recovery file.
- Versioned recovery selection runs before ordinary chunk/line limits and uses the same validated raw snapshot as ordinary transmission. An oversized but valid legacy line can therefore be skipped by an equivalent bounded clear/forget projection after explicit cold cutover. Atomic quota checks, frame limits, integrity digests and read-only legacy behavior remain unchanged.
- The shared classifier reuses the outer PTC result's existing `executionId` and operation IDs. Completed parents remain covered until their recorded late operations have been consumed, even when another occurrence reuses the external tool ID. Read-time evidence names the original parent entry. Legacy records without an execution ID retain chronological matching and accept late data only when the parent is unambiguous; mismatches, duplicate execution IDs and true orphans fail closed. No journal metadata is added.
- Work extraction uses the same safe raw boundaries as compression. Adjacent human admissions are processed as one complete range when a tool group crosses them, including trailing public operation entries. Existing receipts remain readable. Source eligibility is evaluated per original human admission within that range: clear/cutover boundaries and forgotten receipts suppress old evidence and its late results/operations while retaining independent new admissions. The extraction retry maximum stays at three.
- A single in-memory mutation revision invalidates context reads started before/during a mutation or an authoritative unknown-job settlement. This covers both the prompt and manual paged view, including a newer committed proof arriving before an older pending proof. No counter or view state is persisted. Chat/Work modes, ownership, source deletion, runner epochs and final host authority checks are unchanged.

Regression gates include quota refusal followed by repeated short reconnects, local send refusal, lost ACK of a bounded recovery, checkpoint changes and valid byte replacement; a valid legacy line above 8 MiB with a small versioned clear; a real slow hook outliving the unchanged PTC settle grace while the parent ID is reused, plus restart classification; and held view responses delivered after clear/forget ACKs or after a newer committed proof. All fixtures use isolated temporary state, with no activation of existing user ledgers.

Validation on macOS (2026-10-22): 1,057 distinct Rust workspace library/binary tests passed, with 2 existing ignored cases. This combines the complete workspace runs with the final agent-library rerun after adding snapshot recovery coverage, and the strengthened actual-agent restart test. All 60 scenarios across the same 12 real-process conformance targets passed with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`; no golden snapshots were updated. The slow-hook integration outlives the existing PTC settle grace, reuses the parent ID while the old operation is pending, then restarts an actual agent and preserves both recorded tool results. Separate regressions cover invalidating a snapshot created before the late evidence existed, restoring raw context across reopen and safely compacting again. Production no-reduction guards, timeout values and retry limits were unchanged. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting, Markdown formatting and diff whitespace checks passed. Earlier Linux/Nix evidence remains scoped to the original port. No deployment or activation of existing user ledgers was performed. Task-owned build output and temporary scripts/logs were removed after verification.

## Source eligibility and commit-boundary corrections

- A request-local source history shares one validated tool classification between safe boundaries, source annotations and original human admissions. Outer results and nested operations inherit the admission of their actual parent occurrence. Work extraction filters revoked admissions before rendering evidence, including late results after a newer interaction has already completed. A revoked admission cannot suppress an independent newer admission merely because their tool spans overlap. Forgotten legacy observations/reflections and existing receipts remain supported; foreign, deleted and inaccessible sources remain excluded by the same host authority checks.
- Extraction receipts retain their existing schema. A filtered job starts at its first eligible human admission and ends at the existing safe raw endpoint. Its job identity and source hash still bind the full raw range, and commit regenerates the same eligible source set before accepting references. An attempted citation of an excluded old source is rejected before writing. Successful empty receipts and source-specific forget suppression are unchanged.
- Handoff commit revalidates the proposed prefix against the latest retained tail using the existing boundary validator. A late operation arriving during model inference rejects the stale cut before any snapshot is appended. Original context remains available across reopen and can be compressed again at a safe cut, without an additional retry loop.
- Unknown execution prefixes consider every earlier compatible legacy parent rather than selecting an active reused external ID. Ambiguous evidence keeps every possible parent cut unsafe. Existing outer-result execution IDs can resolve the ambiguity on a later read; duplicate identities and unresolved alternatives remain invalid. Bare legacy operation IDs retain chronological matching. No new execution identity, lock or recovery state is persisted.

Regression gates cover clear/forget followed by a new independently supported fact, rejected citations of old sources, cold/clear followed by late outer results and operations, a late operation injected during real handoff inference with reopen/recovery, and missing legacy execution IDs with reused parent IDs before and after the new outer result arrives. Existing Chat/Work authority, immutable ACK retries, cold cutover and retry maxima remain unchanged. All test ledgers are isolated temporary fixtures.

Validation on macOS (2026-10-22): the final complete Rust workspace library/binary run passed 1,060 tests, with 2 existing ignored cases. All 60 scenarios across the same 12 real-process conformance targets passed with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`; no golden snapshots were changed. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting, plan Markdown formatting and diff whitespace checks passed. Regression assertions preserve immutable ACK handling, source revocation, Chat/Work ownership and return-time authority checks, as well as existing retry limits. This run was on macOS; earlier Linux/Nix evidence remains scoped to the original port. No deployment or activation of existing user ledgers was performed. Task-owned build output and scripts/logs were removed after verification.

## Localized legacy PTC ambiguity

- Work source classification retains the existing possible parent occurrences for an ambiguous legacy operation. It excludes human admissions from the earliest possible parent through that operation, without assigning a parent or inventing a successful outcome. Completed calls close only after their last recorded operation; calls without a recorded result remain unknown. A later independent admission can therefore supply evidence even when execution metadata is permanently missing. Strict handoff/compression validation, exact-identity collision checks and true-orphan rejection are unchanged.
- The excluded admissions are derived per request from existing raw history. Source rendering and commit validation both exclude them. No blocked-range receipt, replacement execution ID, lock or recovery file is persisted. Existing valid receipts keep their original schema and do not claim that an ambiguous prefix was extracted.
- Automatic extraction considers only post-cutover/post-clear admissions; excluded legacy backlog does not cause an automatic error. Explicit catchup reports a blocked source when that backlog is in scope. If no safe job remains and any in-scope source is blocked, `workspace.next` returns `workspace_source_blocked` rather than `null`. An unclassifiable source is reported the same way while other authorized sessions remain eligible. Existing client extraction errors and notifications expose the reason, without an additional retry loop or prompt-state mechanism. The new error is a prewrite rejection only; an already unknown original mutation still requires the existing authoritative proof.

Regression gates cover permanently missing execution metadata with completed and unanswered parents; independent sources after an ambiguous span and after explicit cold cutover; a recorded outer result crossing a new admission; rejected citations of ambiguous evidence; reopen without prefix edits or false coverage receipts; blocked catchup; invalid/foreign identities; another authorized session progressing past an unclassifiable source; and a real agent showing the blocked-source error without a model call, commit or automatic retry. Chat/Work authority, old settings, read-only legacy behavior and existing retry maxima are unchanged. All test ledgers are isolated temporary fixtures.

Validation on macOS (2026-10-22): the three new node regressions first failed against the preceding implementation, then passed after the correction. The final full Rust workspace library/binary run passed 1,064 tests with 2 existing ignored cases. All 61 scenarios across 12 real-process conformance targets passed with `PIRC_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1` and `INSTA_UPDATE=no`; no golden snapshots were updated. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting, plan Markdown formatting and diff whitespace checks passed. The new real-agent test verifies a visible notification and panel error, one source request, no model call, no commit and no automatic retry. Source journals remain intact, blocked admissions receive no coverage receipt, and successful independent notes remain readable. No deployment or activation of existing user ledgers was performed. Task-owned build output and temporary scripts/logs were removed after verification. Earlier Linux/Nix evidence remains scoped to the original port.

## Pre-push verification

On 2026-10-23, `git pull --rebase origin main` confirmed that the branch was already based on the current upstream memory port. The preserved changes were restored byte-for-byte before validation. The complete Rust workspace library/binary run passed 1,064 tests with 2 existing ignored cases; all 61 scenarios across 12 required real-process conformance targets passed with golden updates disabled. Workspace/all-target Clippy with `-D warnings`, Rust formatting and diff whitespace checks passed.

A clean Linux/Nix dependency build detected that the added node test dependency changed the vendored lock output. The package's `cargoHash` was updated to the measured value. This packaging correction does not alter runtime behavior, compatibility, authority checks or retry limits. No deployment or activation of existing user ledgers was performed.

Both `pirc-node.cargoDeps` and `pirc-gateway.cargoDeps` then built successfully in the clean Linux/Nix test environment with the corrected hash. This verifies the dependency/vendor outputs; it is separate from the macOS runtime test results above. No golden snapshots were changed.

The pinned Nix formatter check and both package derivation evaluations also passed. The upstream branch was checked again before committing and had not advanced.
