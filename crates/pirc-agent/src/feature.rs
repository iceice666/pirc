//! Built-in extensions (`agent/feature.ts`): features are compiled into the
//! binary, and this is the small hook surface they need. Every hook has a
//! default that does nothing, so a feature implements only its own.
//!
//! The agent calls the hooks in the order of [`crate::features::
//! builtin_features`], where the TS agent did. A hook that returns `Err`
//! is what threw in TS; the agent handles it as TS handled the throw at
//! that call site (a warning, a failed start, a crashed loop).
