//! The host guard on every request and WebSocket of the context (but for
//! the accepted gaps listed at the end), as `node/browser.ts` set it up
//! with Playwright: `context.route('**/*')`
//! (the `Fetch` domain: a blocked request fails with `BlockedByClient`, the
//! rest continue; `Network.setCacheDisabled` as Playwright does while
//! routing), `context.routeWebSocket` (Playwright's main-world WebSocket
//! mock, `assets/websocket-mock.js`: a blocked socket is closed with 1008
//! "blocked by pirc", an allowed one connects), and
//! `serviceWorkers: 'block'`.
//!
//! [`install`] is called by [`super::context`] for every attached target
//! before it is let run (`Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger`). The caller
//! owns `Network.enable` and `Runtime.enable` (needed for
//! `Runtime.bindingCalled`); this module owns `Fetch.*`,
//! `Network.setCacheDisabled`, the bindings and the init scripts.
//!
//! What it does per target kind (Playwright 1.63.0, `crNetworkManager`,
//! `crPage` `FrameSession._initialize`, `crServiceWorker`):
//!
//! - pages and out-of-process iframes: `Network.setCacheDisabled {true}`,
//!   `Fetch.enable {handleAuthRequests: true, patterns: [{urlPattern: '*',
//!   requestStage: 'Request'}]}`, `Runtime.addBinding
//!   {name: '__playwright__binding__'}` and, in the main world with
//!   `runImmediately`, the init scripts in Playwright's order: the bindings
//!   controller, `addBinding('__pwWebSocketBinding')`, the service-worker
//!   block, the WebSocket mock.
//! - dedicated workers: `Network.setCacheDisabled {true}` only (Playwright
//!   skips `Fetch` on worker sessions: their requests pause on the page's).
//! - service workers (and shared workers): see the deviations.
//! - the browser session ([`TargetKind::Browser`], a pirc backstop, see
//!   the deviations): `Fetch.enable {patterns: [{urlPattern: '*',
//!   requestStage: 'Request'}]}` only, installed by the context before
//!   `Target.setAutoAttach`.
//!
//! `Fetch.requestPaused`: an intercepted CORS preflight is fulfilled with
//! Playwright's 204; every other request, redirect hops included (see the
//! deviations), is checked:
//! `Fetch.failRequest {errorReason: 'BlockedByClient'}` or
//! `Fetch.continueRequest {requestId}`. `Fetch.authRequired` answers
//! `Default` (Playwright without credentials).
//!
//! A redirect hop pauses again with the request's `networkId` and the new
//! URL (Chromium 153 sets no `redirectedRequestId` at the `Request`
//! stage). Playwright continues it unrouted, either because its
//! `Network.requestWillBeSent` carries the `redirectResponse` or because
//! the request was already continued (it replays that `continue`). Here a
//! pause whose `networkId` this session already continued is a hop; hops
//! are told apart only to remember a document's refused hop (below).
//!
//! Deviations (each blocks more than Playwright, never less):
//!
//! - Redirect hops are checked like any request. With Playwright (and so
//!   TS) they are not: a subresource's hop reached a blocked host unseen
//!   by `assertAllowed`, which looks only at frame URLs, and a document's
//!   hop (main frame, iframe or popup; a 307/308 keeps a form POST's method
//!   and body) was sent before `assertAllowed` refused the frame that
//!   landed there. A document's refused hop fails its navigation with
//!   `BlockedByClient` (the frame shows Chromium's error page); its URL
//!   (with the fragment) and reason are remembered by frame id
//!   ([`HostGuard::note_refused_hop`], forgotten at the frame's next
//!   navigation), and the manager names them as TS's `assertAllowed` named
//!   the URL the frame landed on (`goto`'s `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`, a frame
//!   on the error page), then leaves the page for `about:blank` as TS did.
//!   The text is TS's whenever the blocked host would have answered; it is
//!   stricter where TS's depended on what the blocked host did with the
//!   request: an unreachable blocked host (TS: Playwright's `net::ERR_…`
//!   goto error), a chain that leaves the blocked host again (TS: no
//!   error), several blocked hops (TS named the last, this the first), and
//!   the history (the error page's entry where TS had the blocked page's).
//!   As no frame can then commit a blocked host's document (DNS rebinding
//!   aside, see [`crate::browser::hosts`]), the manager reads a page after
//!   `assertAllowed` without a second check, as TS did.
//! - Playwright continues a paused request without a `networkId`, and one
//!   whose frame it does not know, without routing it: such a request's URL
//!   would reach the network unchecked. Here every paused request that is
//!   not a preflight is checked. A dedicated
//!   worker's `fetch` pauses without a `networkId` (seen with Chromium 153
//!   when the worker's session has not enabled `Network`).
//! - With `serviceWorkers: 'block'` Playwright gives a service worker no
//!   network manager, so a service worker that runs anyway (the init script
//!   only replaces `navigator.serviceWorker.register` on the instance;
//!   `ServiceWorkerContainer.prototype.register` still works) fetches
//!   unchecked. Here service workers get the same `Fetch` guard as pages.
//! - A backstop on the browser session: `Fetch` enabled there pauses every
//!   target's requests, after the target session's own `Fetch` (if any)
//!   continued them, and the same handler checks them. It is what guards
//!   shared workers (Playwright detaches them, so they run unguarded):
//!   Chromium 153 pauses a shared worker's requests on neither the page's
//!   session nor the worker's own (the context still installs
//!   [`TargetKind::ServiceWorker`] there), only on the browser session's.
//!   It equally sees the targets the context resumes and detaches without
//!   a guard of their own (prerender pages, worklets, future types, which
//!   Playwright leaves unguarded; not exercised: with the cache disabled
//!   Chromium 153 made no preload request at all). A request a
//!   target session refused never reaches the backstop; one it continued
//!   pauses once more and is checked again (the verdict is cached by
//!   [`HostGuard`], so this costs one CDP round trip per request; no
//!   measurable change on the corpus run). Authentication challenges are
//!   left to the target sessions (`handleAuthRequests` unset here).
//! - The bindings controller is pirc's own few lines rather than
//!   Playwright's `BindingsController` (not among the extracted assets): it
//!   defines the same globals and wire envelope (`{name, seq,
//!   serializedArgs}` on `__playwright__binding__`), with the arguments as
//!   plain JSON instead of Playwright's serialization, and resolves a
//!   binding call's promise at once (the mock never awaits it).
//! - Playwright recognizes a CORS preflight by its `Network.requestWillBeSent`
//!   (`initiator.type === 'preflight'`, method `OPTIONS`), which it pairs
//!   with the pause. The pause alone tells it here: `OPTIONS` with an
//!   `Access-Control-Request-Method` header, which only Chromium can set
//!   (a forbidden request header for pages); the paused event's resource
//!   type is the request's own (`XHR`), not `Preflight`.
//! - An allowed WebSocket is dispatched `passthrough` (the mock connects and
//!   relays itself), where Playwright's `connectToServer()` dispatches
//!   `connect` and relays every message through its client: the page sees
//!   the same socket. A page `close()` before the verdict is relayed as
//!   Playwright's client does (`closeServer`, then `closePage`).
//!
//! Accepted gaps (decided with the user on 2026-10-12): each is equal to
//! TS, whose Playwright guard has the same holes, and through each an
//! untrusted page reaches a blocked host (verified with Chromium 153
//! unless noted):
//!
//! - WebSockets. `Fetch` never sees a handshake, and no CDP command blocks
//!   one (`Network.setBlockedURLs` on page and worker sessions let the
//!   sockets connect); `Network.webSocketCreated` only reports one after
//!   the fact. The only guard is Playwright's main-world mock, in the realm
//!   the page's own scripts share:
//!   - `ws.url` is a writable property, and the mock connects to it after
//!     the verdict on the URL it reported at construction: set right after
//!     `new WebSocket(<allowed URL>)`, the socket connects to the new URL.
//!   - `__pwWebSocketDispatch` is a page-visible global: called with a
//!     pending socket's `_id` (also page-visible) and `type:
//!     'passthrough'`, it connects that socket whatever the verdict.
//!   - An allowed socket in passthrough keeps the native socket in its
//!     page-visible `_ws`: `new (ws._ws.constructor)(<blocked URL>)`
//!     connects with the native `WebSocket`, unchecked.
//!   - Workers have no mock: dedicated workers (nested ones too), shared
//!     workers and service workers (registered through
//!     `ServiceWorkerContainer.prototype.register`) open sockets to any
//!     host and port.
//!
//!   A handshake is an HTTP GET with a path and `Origin` the page chooses,
//!   and WebSockets have no CORS: a local WebSocket server that does not
//!   check `Origin` (dev servers' hot reload, local agents, debuggers)
//!   gives the page full read and write.
//! - Connections that are no request `Fetch` pauses:
//!   - `<link rel=preconnect>` and Chromium's own preconnect for a
//!     navigation open TCP connections to a blocked host (no bytes are
//!     sent; the request that would follow is refused);
//!   - WebRTC: STUN and TURN (UDP, and TURN/TCP allocations) reach blocked
//!     hosts, which is how browser LAN scans work (`icecandidateerror`);
//!   - WebTransport (HTTP/3 over QUIC) is not intercepted either (not
//!     tested).
//!
//! Closing them takes egress enforced outside the page (for example a
//! node-local proxy that applies [`HostGuard`] to every connection
//! Chromium makes), which is not done.
//!
