# Historical records in Git

[All documentation](../README.md) · [Active plans](../../plans/README.md)

Completed implementation diaries and evaluation artifacts are kept in Git rather than maintained alongside current documentation. Use the [architecture references](../architecture/README.md), [user guides](../guides/README.md) and [deployment guides](../deploy/README.md) for current behavior. Historical proposals, commands and paid-run approvals are not current instructions or permission to rerun an evaluation.

## Retrieve the retired documents

The complete pre-cleanup snapshot is commit `af7074fc51742e79c8f0c76a9aaf64f80b414f7e`. In a clone containing that commit:

```sh
# List the original files, including the 11 unchanged PTC JSON artifacts.
git ls-tree -r --name-only af7074fc51742e79c8f0c76a9aaf64f80b414f7e -- docs/history docs/evaluations/ptc

# Read a record without restoring obsolete files into the working tree.
git show af7074fc51742e79c8f0c76a9aaf64f80b414f7e:docs/history/rust-rewrite.md
git show af7074fc51742e79c8f0c76a9aaf64f80b414f7e:docs/history/security-audit.md
git show af7074fc51742e79c8f0c76a9aaf64f80b414f7e:docs/evaluations/ptc/ptc-only.md
```

That snapshot also contains the assistant, browser, schedules (`cron.md`), sandbox and old Android client designs, plus the full implementation/validation diaries in `plans/README.md` and `plans/mobile.md`. Current assistant contracts and accepted security decisions are maintained in [assistant memory](../architecture/assistant-memory.md) and [security decisions](../architecture/security-decisions.md).

Earlier consolidated plans (`assistant.md`, `project-isolation.md`, `backlog.md`, `mobile-audit.md`, `security-audit.md`) can be read with `git show 7677d24:plans/<file>.md`. Prompt customization's baseline is `69ae62c`; the former UI redesign was implemented in `4ce2c40`, `4a3e46f` and `ea76001`. Prompt customization's current contracts are in [Prompt and Context](../architecture/prompt-context.md).

## PTC evaluation outcome

The hybrid surface was accepted and merged on **2026-10-07**: core tools are exposed directly and through `ptc`, and other capabilities through `ptc`. The original PTC-only target was superseded, not shown to pass. Current behavior is documented in [tools](../guides/tools.md) and [PTC runtime contracts](../architecture/ptc.md).

The retired `docs/evaluations/ptc/` records distinguish:

- The stopped Opus baseline and its preflights, which are not a completed baseline.
- The accepted OpenAI M1 baseline: **300 measured trials and 150 primes**.
- M4 rounds 1 and 2: failed bounds; round 3: incomplete, with no verdict.
- M4 rounds 4 and 5: hybrid comparisons that still failed the original bounds.
- The later 19-exercise public holdout: passed its separately declared bounds, with the recorded oracle caveat; chat limitations were accepted, not regraded.

The protocols, amendments, budgets, hashes, oracle limitations and all 11 JSON artifacts remain together in the snapshot above. Evaluation tooling was removed after the Rust cutover; the last TypeScript revision is `2d480d3`. Removing files from the current tree does not change their historical outcomes or authorize spending, resetting attempt markers, or rerunning the old tools. Later fixes were not automatically re-measured.

## Rust cutover and validation scope

The Rust rewrite's M0–M9 records describe the gateway/node/agent port and the TypeScript conformance baseline; source comments referring here identify that history, not an unfinished migration. The cutover did not import the old state, and incompatible gateway/node protocols cannot be mixed; see [upgrades](../deploy/upgrades.md).

The user **waived**, rather than passed, the remaining full PTC/task-time comparison, native real-provider/subscription smoke-test gate and unresolved polyglot review/accounting results. See the snapshot's `docs/history/rust-rewrite.md` “M9 Cutover” and `docs/history/security-audit.md` for the original decision and evidence. Current accepted boundaries live in [security decisions](../architecture/security-decisions.md); remaining manual checks live in [plans](../../plans/README.md). Reopening paid comparisons requires a new agreed protocol, budget and credentials.
